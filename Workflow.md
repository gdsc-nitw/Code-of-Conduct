# Development Workflow

[![Discord](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/discord?icon=discord&label)](https://discord.gg/fga8hUxd8T)

## Code of Conduct

Read [Code of Conduct](README.md).

## Contributors

```fork -> clone -> make changes -> push -> create PR```

## Core Members & Maintainers

```clone -> branch -> make changes -> push -> create PR```

## Missing Issues tab

Some projects may not have issues tab as this is done on purpose. You may get hold of core members on Discord for filing an issue or bug.

## Etiquette

Utilize the [Issues](templates/ISSUE_TEMPLATES.md) and [Pull Request](templates/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) templates at appropriate places. Take example of [this](https://github.com/gdsc-nitw/gdsc-nitw.github.io/pull/2) to create a good Pull Request.
